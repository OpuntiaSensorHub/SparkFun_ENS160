## Features

- **Air Quality Index Measurement:** Provides an overall assessment of air quality.
- **Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) Detection:** Measures the concentration of TVOCs in the air.
- **Estimated CO2 (eCO2) Levels:** Estimates the level of carbon dioxide in the environment.
- **Compatibility with ESP32:** Seamlessly integrates with ESP32 for advanced applications.
- **Serial Output:** Outputs readings to the serial monitor for easy visualization.

## Hardware Requirements

- SparkFun EN160 Sensor
- ESP32 Module
- Standard wiring cables

## Setup and Installation

1. **Sensor Connection:** Connect the EN160 sensor to the ESP32 module. [Place Holder for Wiring Diagram]
2. **Power Supply:** Ensure a consistent power supply for accurate measurements.
3. **Environment Setup:** Position the sensor in an appropriate location for air quality monitoring.

## Usage

This repository provides basic test code to interface the SparkFun EN160 sensor with an ESP32. The code outputs the Air Quality Index, TVOC, and eCO2 readings to the serial monitor.

### Simple Test Code

To check the functionality of the sensor, run the `test.ino` file in the Arduino IDE. This script initializes the SparkFun EN160 sensor and outputs the air quality readings to the serial monitor. Follow the same steps as outlined in the Adafruit SHT31 sensor README.
